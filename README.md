## Bagging Ensemble of Custom Data Mining Algorithms

Installation
------------
These components need to be installed first:
- OpenJDK 11
- Hadoop 3.3.5
- Maven (Tested with version 3.6.3)
- AWS CLI (Tested with version 1.22.34)

- Scala 2.12.17 (you can install this specific version with the Coursier CLI tool which also needs to be installed)
- Spark 3.3.2 (without bundled Hadoop)

After downloading the hadoop and spark installations, move them to an appropriate directory:

`mv hadoop-3.3.5 /usr/local/hadoop-3.3.5`

`mv spark-3.3.2-bin-without-hadoop /usr/local/spark-3.3.2-bin-without-hadoop`

Environment
-----------
1) Example ~/.bash_aliases:
	```
	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
	export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop-3.3.5
	export YARN_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop
	export SCALA_HOME=/usr/share/scala
	export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark-3.3.2-bin-without-hadoop
	export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin:$SCALA_HOME/bin:$SPARK_HOME/bin
	export SPARK_DIST_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)
	```

2) Explicitly set `JAVA_HOME` in `$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh`:

	`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`

Execution
---------
All of the build & execution commands are organized in the Makefile.
1) Unzip project file.
2) Open command prompt.
3) Navigate to directory where project files unzipped.
4) Edit the Makefile to customize the environment at the top.
	Sufficient for standalone: hadoop.root, jar.name, local.input
	Other defaults acceptable for running standalone.
5) In Makefile,
    - `job.name=ensemble.EnsembleBagging` for Decision Tree + Naive Bayes ensemble 
    - `job.name=ensemble.KnnEnsemble` for KNN ensemble
5) Standalone Hadoop:
	- `make switch-standalone`		-- set standalone Hadoop environment (execute once)
	- `make local-knn`				-- run KNN ensemble locally
	- `make local`					-- run Decision Tree + Naive Bayes ensemble locally
6) AWS EMR Hadoop: (you must configure the emr.* config parameters at top of Makefile)
	- `make make-bucket`			-- only before first execution
	- `make upload-input-aws`		-- only before first execution
	- `make aws-knn`				-- run KNN ensemble on AWS. Check for successful execution with web interface (aws.amazon.com)
    - `make aws-dn`				    -- run Decision Tree and Naive Bayes ensemble on AWS. Check for successful execution with web interface (aws.amazon.com)
